# User's Manual

## 1. Program Description
P1PP is a modular C preprocessor that performs a reduced set of preprocessing tasks required for Practice 1. It reads a `.c` or `.h` source file, optionally removes comments, processes a limited set of preprocessor directives (`#include`, `#define`, `#ifdef/#endif`), and expands object-like macros. The tool is implemented as a single-pass engine that processes input line by line and produces a preprocessed output file with the suffix `_pp`.

Supported features:
- Comment removal (`//`, `/* */`)
- `#include "file"` (local includes only)
- Object-like `#define` and macro expansion
- `#ifdef` / `#endif` conditional inclusion

Not supported (left unchanged in output):
- `#include <...>`
- Function-like / parametrized macros (`#define NAME(x) ...`)

## 2. Usage Syntax
```
preprocessor <flags> <input_file.c|input_file.h>
```

## 3. Command-Line Options
- `-c`: Remove comments (default if no flags are provided)
- `-d`: Process directives and macros (keeps comments)
- `-all`: Enable all supported processing (`-c -d`)
- `-help`: Print help/usage and exit

## 4. Input Files
- Accepts `.c` or `.h` files (any text file is allowed)
- Local includes using `#include "file"` are supported
- System includes (`#include <stdio.h>`) are not processed and remain unchanged
- Function-like macros are preserved but not expanded

## 5. Output Files
- Output is written to a new file in the same directory
- Filename is generated by inserting `_pp` before the extension:
  - `input-example.c` -> `input-example_pp.c`
  - `header.h` -> `header_pp.h`

## 6. Usage Examples
```
preprocessor input-example.c
preprocessor -d input-example.c
preprocessor -all input-example.c
preprocessor -help
```
